## Black Glass Nova skin for Kodi 19 Matrix
Black Glass Nova is an easy to use and fanart oriented skin designed for Full HD TV screens.

This skin was forked (Leia version) from :

https://github.com/Tgxcorporation/skin.blackglassnova

Then "updated" to matrix from a forum zip:

https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=360747

(the actual update so far was minimal, updating version # and dropping some requirements, so nnot a fully Matrix updated skin, but should at least be somewhat operational).

Am posting here for myself and others as a starting point for matrix.
